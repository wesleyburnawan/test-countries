## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS Library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS Framework
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - React.js Library
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org//) - Build Tools
- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) - JS Linter

### What I learned

This is the first time I am developing an app with ReactJS from scratch, by means rather than using the usual `create-react-app`, I try to build the React App from empty npm package. Yeah, it's a tough way to get there, but trust me, you will learn a lot of how React is created under the hood and you can choose which package to be included to your project to maximize your workflow. And I think this method is kinda unique as nowadays it's hard to find tutorial or guide to learn React the hard way. In this project also features `dark mode` utility where it's my first time developing it and `Tailwind CSS` does a great job in providing the functionality.

### Continued development

There's a lot of improvement there, such as the design and the messy code that I have put inside. So I will improve the code in the future.

### Useful resources

- [Dark Mode](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/react/dark-mode/) - This helped me for dark mode reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Async and Await](https://javascript.info/async-await) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand async and await. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
